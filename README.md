# Air-Canvas-using-openCv-and-Mediapipe
The overview of this project is to develop a real-time gesture-based drawing system using mediapipe, NumPy, and Python. It allows users to sketch in the air with their fingertips, which  Mediapipe's hand-tracking capabilities can detect and track. Real-time drawing is made possible by using NumPy to map  the fingertip coordinates to a virtual canvas. The system has a number of features, including the ability to change stroke  colour, alter brush size, and erase strokes, all of which are  managed by simple hand motions. The project showcases the  combination of computer vision and numerical computing  libraries for creative applications, showing the possibility for immersive and interactive drawingÂ experiences.
